# Topic Overview: Design Patterns
Design Patterns offers a short and sweet introduction — just one lesson — to this ever-elusive computer science topic.

> **Remember**: A lesson consists of myGA module(s) to introduce the concept and in-class exercise(s) to implement the concept as needed.

We estimate that this lesson will take about 1.5 hours to complete. Here's how that breaks down across myGA and in-class time:

| Modality | # of Modules | Estimated time |
|---|---|---|
| myGA | 1 | 0.5 hours |
| In class | 1 | 1 hour |

## Materials Available
The lesson folder linked below contains:
* A **student-facing README** that outlines what's covered in the lesson.
* A **student-facing Exercises folder** with instructions, exercise files, and test scripts.
* **Instructor-only materials** in the Solutions and Instructor Guide folder, including solution code and teaching tips.

The lesson folder also provides additional resources (reading materials, videos, etc.) for you and your students.

## Lesson Breakdown
There's only one Design Patterns lesson — just an introduction of the topic — which is in Tier 2. 

| Tier | Lesson name | myGA module(s) name | In-class exercise(s) |
