# express-views-exercise

## Exercise Objectives

gain practice:

* writing RESTful routes
* Writing an application using MVC
* using `handlebars` to create views

In this assignment, we continue working on your coffee shop app. You will
create a single page that manages a list of coffee shops.

Your web page will need to:

* provide a web page that lists all bank accounts 

# Setup

```
cd atm
npm install
```

## Write Controller

Write RESTFul routes in `server.js` that provides an HTTP controller to the
bankAPI (the Model). See the comments in the file for which routes to create.

__NOTE__ feel free to modify the Model API found in the `api/` directory if you
need to change the functionality the API provides.

### Write Views

Using handlebars write the views necessary to provide a web interface for
interacting with the list of coffee shops.

Put each view in the `./coffee-shops/views/` directory.
