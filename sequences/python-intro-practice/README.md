# Python Koans

Koans are short exercises that build off of each other. Finish an exercise by
getting the test to pass. With each passing test, you will achieve a higher
level of Python enlightenment. üßò‚Äç

## Prerequisites

* Basic Python

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone the [Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans) repository
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

You'll be working through the koans provided in the [Python
Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans) repository. Fork and clone
that repository (not this one). Work through the koans in the `python3/`
directory.  In order to run the tests, make sure you are in the `python3/` directory and run the command `python3 contemplate_koans.py` in your terminal.

Commit and push your code as you go! You should have one commit per
section.  When you finish the required sections, push your commits to GitHub and
submit to the GA Grader.

Unless otherwise specified on the calendar or by an instructor, homework is due
the next morning by 9:00am.

[Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans) has 37 sections,
