### Overview

For your 3rd project, you will be building an application using the 
MERN stack. ​ Use your imagination! You get to create whatever you want for this app. 
Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough 
programming challenges.

You'll need to run your user stories, wireframes, and database design by your 
instructors to get their feedback and approval before you begin coding! Remember 
to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope 
creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

Identify what you need to build and accomplish to meet project expectations and 
identify everything else as stretch goals. If you meet your MVP (Minimum Viable 
Product) ahead of schedule, you can decide which reach goals to focus on for the 
remainder of your time.

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* Use React as a front-end library
* Have at _least_ 3 models (more if makes sense)
    - Remember that many-to-many relationships are difficult in MongoDB and focus on one-to-many relationships for your MVP
* Have full CRUD on at _least_ one of your models
* Be able to Add/Delete on any remaining models
* Use the Mongoose library to write Mongo queries
* Have high quality code:
    - Follow accepted naming conventions
    - Consistent indentation
    - Well-structured and readable code
    - Semantic naming of variables, functions, CSS classes, etc.
    - Short and clear functions that _do one thing_
    - Efficient code- if you have your MVP, refactor
    - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code
* Be deployed on Heroku

#### Stretch Goals (awarded only after all other technical requirements are met)
* 3rd model
* Full CRUD on all models
* External API

### Documentation
* A `README.md` file containing:
  - A project description
  - A link to the Deployed App
  - A link to the Trello Board
  - A link to the Wirefames, Mockups, and ERDs (or inline photos / screenshots will work too!)
  - A list of technologies, libraries, and/or frameworks used in the project, such as `Node`, `Express`, `Mongo`, `Mongoose` and `React`
  - What you would like to add in version 2
* Wireframes or Mockups -- what does the app look like?
  - Simple: take a picture of a whiteboard drawing
  - Advanced: use a tool such as [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) or [Mockingbird](https://gomockingbird.com/home)
* User Stories in a *PUBLIC* [Trello](https://trello.com/) board
  - You should have a Trello board tracking your User Stories
  - Board lists should include:
    * Backlog
    * Todo
    * In Progress
    * Under Review
    * Done
    * Icebox

### How to Get Started
* First design your _MVP_ (Minimum Viable Product). Have a plan for completing an MVP before getting too involved with _advanced_ features.
* Use _Trello_ to prioritize your User Stories / features. Focus on what is most important / critical to success.
* _Timebox_ any experimental or optional ideas, features, or technologies. Remember that good _time management_ is key!
* Commit your code early and often with good commit messages.
* Use Git Branching for experimenting with different ideas and technologies.

### How To Submit
* Submit your project github link to the GA Grader by the time indicated on the class schedule.
