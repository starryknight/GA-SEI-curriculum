## Naming Conventions

Branches should follow the following pattern:

    <initials>-<feature-name>-<issue-number>

for example:

    nh-new-awesome-lesson-73

This helps those who are reviewing your changes to know who is making the changes and 
what issue you're working on.

# Issues

Issues should try and follow the following guidelines:

* Keep 1 issue per logical problem
* Provide more detail than the title.
* Attach lables and/or milestones as when they apply

# Pull Requests

When you're done working on a feature submit a pull request and request another
team member to review your work. (For Instructor Assistants, please have a lead
instructor review your work as well).

* submitter fixes merge conflicts
* try and have at least 1 reviewer
* put "fixes #issue-number" in pr title
* have LI merge
