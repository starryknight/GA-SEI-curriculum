# Contributing to sei-curriculum

# Starting Out

1. Read this guide
1. Fork this repo (please do not work directly off of this repo)
1. Set your upstream remote to point to this repo

# Workflow

1. Make sure your local master is up-to-date with upstream/master
1. Create a branch using the naming conventions discussed below.
1. Create small, logical commits. This will make reverting new features and
   merging easier.
1. Create a pull request when you're done
1. Fix any merge conflicts that may exist (see section on pull requests)

# Branching

## Naming Conventions

Branches should follow the following pattern:

    <initials>-<feature-name>-<issue-number>
for example:

    nh-new-awesome-lesson-73

This helps those who are reviewing your changes to know who is making the changes and 
what issue you're working on.

# Issues

Issues should try and follow the following guidelines:

* Keep 1 issue per logical problem
* Provide more detail than the title.
* Attach lables and/or milestones as when they apply

# Pull Requests

When you're done working on a feature submit a pull request and request another
team member to review your work. (For Instructor Assistants, please have a lead
instructor review your work as well).

## Pull Request Titles

When making a PR please start the title with the following pattern:

    fixes #<issue-number>
for example:

    fixes #73
This way when the PR gets merged Github can automagically close out the issue.

Keep the following in mind when reviewing guidelines:

## Merge Conflicts

It is the feature branch owner's responsibility to fix any merge conflicts that
may exist. This saves the person reviewing your work time and effort. A
conflict should rarely occur unless your are not keeping your branch updated by
periodically merging in upstream changes (via `git fetch upstream/master; git
merge upstream/master` when checkedout in your feature branch).
